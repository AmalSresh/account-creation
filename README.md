# account-creation

This project gives the user the option to register a new account, login to an existing account, and recover and existing account if the credentials were forgotten. All usernames and passwords are stored in a text file "records.txt" where the new account information is stored and where user inputted information can be compared to the file to authenticate the user login.

This program is a tutorial following the YouTube video "Registration And Login Form In C++ | How To Create Login Page In C++ | C++ Tutorial | Simplilearn" from the user Simplilearn. 
The code only has minor modifications and the program was created for purely educational purposes.
